# Bias-T
-------------------------------------------------------  
Bias-T is implemented using the BSF instead of inductor. The reason will be cleared in the manual.  

Analysis of various parameters have been included. 

Follow the manual to have a clear understanding of your implementation.  

The outputs are plotted using MATLAB. However, HFSS can itself let you export the plots.  

We will be using this BSF for further integration in a Bi
