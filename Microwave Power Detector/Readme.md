# Microwave Power Detector Using SBD(SCHOTTKY BARRIER DIODE)  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis have been carried out using ADS. We can also analyse Detector circuit using BJT or CMOS.  

The key learning in the manual is the use of Harmonic Balance Simulation.  

Various Parameters have been studied including the Non-linearity of the circuit. 

However, we must note that Power Detector is a linear circuit.
