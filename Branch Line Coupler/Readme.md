# Branched Line Coupler
---------------------------------------
Use the documents to implement BLC at your own desired frequency.  

MATLAB is used for plotting the graphs.  

However, the graphs can simply be exported by the HFSS Software itself.  

The same applications can be used for RRC (Rat Race Coupler).
