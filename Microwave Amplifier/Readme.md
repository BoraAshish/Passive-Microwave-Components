# Microwave Amplifier at 7.8  GHz
-------------------------------------------------------  
Analysis of various parameters have been included. 

Follow the manual to have a clear understanding of your implementation.  
  
We will be using the BJT for the implementation.  

Using ADS we can see the Stability Circle and Gain and make an inference out of it.
